# n-bread-association
An application helps DGIST members buy bundled product together.

## purpose
When shopping online, bundled products are usually less expensive than those sold in
individual pieces. However, since it is not common for students to use or eat one thing that much,
DGIST members should pay more to buy less stuff. N빵협회 is an app to solve this problem. On this
app, DGIST members can see the list of products that other members registered. If one could not find
items they want, they can register a new one. In this case, the student is called the host. When they
find one, the user can enroll their name to the list to indicate that they want to buy that product. After
a sufficient number of members are enrolled, the host and the registered members can order the stuff
online.
